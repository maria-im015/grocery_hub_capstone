# grocery_hub_capstone

This web-app will help people keep track of what is in stock in their pantries, fridges, and freezers. It will use the user's phone camera or a USB barcode scanner to scan a product's barcode, the barcode will help store the product in the database. The database will keep track of what is in stock and will also allow the user to keep a grocery store list for future use.
